reports of any damage or injuries during the incident, and although police held back onlookers, at least one bystander managed to capture video of the event.\nThe circus said that Sabu may have escaped after being frightened by storms near Zurich.\n\"After returning to the circus, she was said to be tired, but \"\"pleased to be back.\"\"\"\nWelsh poet Dannie Abse (81) and his wife Joan (78) were involved in a car crash while driving from Golders Green to their holiday home in Ogmore-by-Sea, South Wales.\n\"Mrs. Abse died instantly; Mr Abse suffered a broken rib.\"\nThe couple was returning from a poetry reading that they both had given.\nDannie Abse is an esteemed Jewish writer who lives in Glamorgan, South Wales.\nJoan Abse, his wife, was an art historian and writer.\nDannie Abse is well-known for being a poet and a medical doctor.\nAbse, in fact, was a specialist at a chest clinic for over thirty years.\nBut Abse is best known for his writings and has received numerous literary awards and fellowships.\nIn 1989, he received an honorary doctorate from the Universities of Wales.\nThe couple worked together editing two books in the 1980s.\nJoan Abse leaves behind her husband, a son, and two daughters.\nPalestinian extremist group Hamas has been invited to meet with representatives of the South African government.\nHamas won the Palestinian legislative council elections of January 2006 by a landslide and is now faced with forming a government and strained ties to European Union and the United States, which classify it as a terrorist organization responsible for several suicide attacks.\nThe South African deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad confirmed on Thursday that the country is preparing a meeting with the controversial group.\nAccording to Pahad South Africa wishes to share its experiences on the transformation from the Apartheid-era to democracy with the Palestinians and Israel.\nSouth Africa also sees it important to keep in contact with Hamas in the search for peace in the Middle East.\nSami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spookesman said that there is no date for talks with South Africa yet.\nRussia has invited leaders of the Hamas for talks, which will begin on Friday.\nThe Russian invitation was the first one after the elections of January 2006.\nHowever, Russia has put Hamas under pressure to recognize Israel and renounce violence.\nThere have been talks between Hamas leaders and the Turkish foreign minister, Abdullah Gul.\n\"Israeli foreign ministry spokesman voiced his ministry's concerns that \"\"giving legitimacy to an unreformed Hamas\"\" could turn the movement \"\"from a terrorist organization to a political party\"\".\"\nGary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 2004/2005 season of the National Hockey League has been canceled.\nThe announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days.\nThe dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players.\nThe majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount.\nThe club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million.\n\"Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said \"\"The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.\"\"\"\nThis will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded.\nThat year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off.\nMichael Jackson's This Is It, a documentary film based on world-famous singer Michael Jackson rehearsing for his last tour before his untimely death, will be premiered in at least 15 cinemas in cities all over the world simultaneously.\nThe film is due to premiere on October 27 and October 28.\nThe world c", "source_lang": "zh", "target_text": "V\u00e0o kho\u1ea3ng n\u0103m 2000 gi\u1edd
