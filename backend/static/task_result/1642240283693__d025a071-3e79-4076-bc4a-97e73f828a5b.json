{"source_text": "\"Israeli foreign ministry spokesman voiced his ministry's concerns that \"\"giving legitimacy to an unreformed Hamas\"\" could turn the movement \"\"from a terrorist organization to a political party\"\".\"\r\nGary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 2004/2005 season of the National Hockey League has been canceled.\r\nThe announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days.\r\nThe dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players.\r\nThe majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount.\r\nThe club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million.\r\n\"Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said \"\"The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.\"\"\"\r\nThis will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded.\r\nThat year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off.\r\nMichael Jackson's This Is It, a documentary film based on world-famous singer Michael Jackson rehearsing for his last tour before his untimely death, will be premiered in at least 15 cinemas in cities all over the world simultaneously.\r\nThe film is due to premiere on October 27 and October 28.\r\nThe world cities may be in different time zones with different dates but they will all be premiering the film at exactly the same time.\r\nOne such premiere location is Los Angeles, in the US state of California, which will have the film starting at 1800 PT.\r\nAnother simultaneity is the Odeon Leicester Square cinema in London, England, which will start at 0100 GMT on October 27.\r\nOther locations holding concurrent premieres are the South African city of Johannesburg, New York City in New York, German capital Berlin, Russian capital city Moscow, Japanese capital Tokyo, Australian city Sydney, French capital Paris, South Korean city Seoul, and Rio de Janeiro, a large city in Brazil.\n\n\nMichael Jackson died on June 25, 2009 aged 50, after suffering from a cardiac arrest.\r\nThe movie will feature some of the rehearsal footage made in the weeks before his death.\r\nIn total, there will be at least 25 cinemas premiering the film, but not all of them will be released simultaneously.\r\nSony Pictures, the film production company, have yet to announce the other cities involved.\r\nTickets for the film will be available to purchase from Sunday, September 27.\r\nThe film is directed by Kenny Ortega, who previously directed all the High School Musical films.\r\nHe also directed some significant Michael Jackson events, such as his This Is It concert and Jackson's memorial service.\r\n\"Jeff Blake, chairman of worldwide marketing and distribution for Sony Pictures, said: \"\"Michael Jackson has an army of fans everywhere around the world... we are giving the audiences an incredible opportunity to join together in celebration of Michael Jackson's incredible career.\"\"\"\r\nZimbabwe tied the second Group D match in the World Cup against Ireland at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica.\r\nFour male members of the paparazzi were arrested and charged on Wednesday with reckless driving in Mission Hills, California after following Britney Spears back to her mansion.\r\nAt least four others were also stopped by police, but were not arrested.\r\nAccording to reports, police witnessed the entire incident saying that a fleet of paparazzi were following Spears at a high rate of speed around 11:20 p.m. PST (UTC-8).\r\nThey also say they followed her too closely and made unsafe lane changes in order to follow her.\r\nPolice also say that at least one of cars following Spears, who was driving her car, tried to run her off the road, but she was not able to identify the vehicle or the occupants.\r\nThey are reported to have verified her identity, and released her.", "source_lang": "en", "target_text": "\"Ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u00e1t ng\u00f4n B\u1ed9 Ngo\u1ea1i giao Israel cho
