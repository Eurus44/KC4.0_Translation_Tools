{"source_text": "The next major competition ahead of the 2014 Winter Paralympics is the test event in Sochi, Russia in March of this year.\r\nA family of four adults and one minor has been reported dead after the house they were inhabiting in the city of Pichilemu, in Chile was allegedly intentionally set on fire on Sunday morning.\r\nIt's a great tragedy for the Pichileminian and couldn't pass unnoticed.\r\nThe police haven't been able to contact their respective relatives.\r\nDozens of people gathered outside the burnt house during Sunday afternoon.\r\nIt is believed that the fire affected at least five other homes.\r\nNew Zealand, Australia and England started their 2007 Rugby World Cup campaigns today with victories over Italy, Japan and the United States respectively.\r\nAustralia and tournament favorites New Zealand comprehensively defeated their opposition, while defending champions England produced a comparatively unimpressive display to overcome the American team.\r\nTournament favourites New Zealand dominated their opening match against Italy.\r\nRichie McCaw opened the scoring after just 64 seconds and scored again in the seventh minutes.\r\nTries from Doug Howlett, Mils Muliaina and two from Sitiveni Sivivatu increased the All Black's imposing lead.\r\nJust before half time, Marko Stanojevic scored a try for Italy taking the score to 43-7.\r\nAfter the interval New Zealand scored five more tries, two each from Howlett and Jerry Collins and one from Chris Jack, with All Blacks fly half Daniel Carter kicking seventeen points during the match.\r\nIn the 71st minute, Mirco Bergamasco scored a consolation try for Italy.\r\nAustralia scored thirteen tries against Japan in their opening match.\r\nA try from Nathan Sharpe and a hat-trick from Rocky Elsom put the Wallabies ahead by 23-3 at half time.\r\nAustralia overwhelmed Japan in the second half, scoring nine tries without reply.\r\nChris Latham, Berrick Barnes and Drew Mitchell claimed two tries each, and Adam Ashley-Cooper, George Smith and Adam Frier completed Australia's victory.\r\nJapan's only points came from a K\u014dsei Ono penalty just before half time, while Stirling Mortlock kicked 27 points for Australia.\r\nIn contrast to the day's earlier matches, the England team overcame the United States by only eighteen points.\r\nAfter 31 minutes the score was 9-3 with all points coming from penalties.\r\nHowever Jason Robinson and Olly Barkley scored tries late in the first half for England, with the score 21-3 at half time.\r\nNine minutes after the interval Tom Rees scored England's third try, but they were not able to score again.\r\nMatekitonga Moeakiola scored for the Americans in the 74th minute.\r\nHans and Josie Schaffer of Bedford, United Kingdom are possibly world record holders, now that they have a total of 99 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\r\nThe pensioners spend most of the year saving for Christmas gifts.\r\nTheir eleven children have brought them 56 grandchildren and 43 great-grandchildren.\r\nThe kids just kept coming \u2013 and then their kids just kept coming, said Josie, 77, to the Sun newspaper.\r\nHusband Hans was a prisoner of war in World War II, and went to work as a farmer for Josie's family.\r\nWhile there is no existing record with Guinness for alive couples with the most grandchildren, Guinness World Records authorities say the couple very well might hold the record.\r\nGlasgow resident Margaret McMillan had 123 grandchildren, but died last year at 98.\r\nIt wasn't until her funeral that the number, which included 15 great-great-grandchildren, was established by the family.\r\nGovernor Jon Corzine announced a bill that would provide $270 million to stem cell research.\r\n\"He announced, \"\"I don't want New Jersey to join the crowd of stem cell research states, I want New Jersey to lead it.\"\"\"\r\nBusinessWeek reports that the announcement came two days after Corzine announced that the state will give out $10 million in research grants next year, including $7 million for stem cell research.\r\nA 15-year-old boy who allegedly stole a Melbourne, Australia tram and drove for 40 minutes picking up and setting down passengers, may yet be allowed to work as a tram driver, despite his nine charges related to the incident.\r\nWe have a very good recruiting policy and anybody who passes the muster for our recruiting policy we'd be glad to offer a job to, provided he's old enough to hold a driver's license, Yarra Trams Deputy Chief Executive, Dennis Cliche, told Australian Associated Press on Monday.\r\n\"Detective Senior Constable Barry Hills of Victoria Police, said of the boy, \"\"He's a nice lad, he's a good lad.\"\"\"\r\nI think his obsession just got the better of him.\r\nDescribed as wearing a jacket similar to official Yarra Trams uniforms, the boy was caught on Sunday night by police in east suburban Kew, 15km from where the tram was stolen, when electricity was shut off to the route.\r\nHe is also accused of stealing a tram on Friday night, from South Melbourne depot.\n\nPolice also say that at least one of cars following Spears, who was driving her car, tried to run her off the road, but she was not able to identify the vehicle or the occupants.\r\nThey are reported to have verified her identity, and released her.\r\nTMZ.com reports that police were checking to see if her license was valid, and was surprised that it was.\r\nSpears was not charged with anything and despite the paparazzis' recklessness, Spears did not want the men arrested.\r\nBritney Spears was part of the group, but was not driving recklessly, said spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, Sara Faden.\r\nThe IPC Alpine World Championships wrapped up yesterday in La Molina, Spain with a friendly, non-medal counting team event won by Austria.\r\nThe winner was tabulated based on the fastest score for a visually impaired skier on the team, a female skier on the team, and a male skier on the team.\r\nThe Austrian team included Markus Salcher, Roman Rabl, and Claudia Loesch for times counted, with Philipp Bonadimann, Thomas Grochar, and Martin Wuerz also competing.\r\nThe team event included ten teams representing eight countries, with the United States and Canada having two teams each and 54 skiers competing.\r\nThe United States team 1 came in second with Tyler Walker, Mark Bathum, and Alana Nichols times counting, and Heath Calhoun, Ralph Green, and Allison Jones also belonging to the team.\r\nRussia came in third with Ivan Frantseva, Alexandr Alyabyev, and Mariya Papulova having their scores counted.\r\nHosts Spain finished last with Jon Santacana, \u00d3scar Espallargas, and \u00darsula Pueyo having their times counting, and Gabriel Gorce and Nathalie Carpanedo also members of the Spanish team.\r\nThe next major competition ahead of the 2014 Winter Paralympics is the test event in Sochi, Russia in March of this year.", "source_lang": "en", "target_text": "Cu\u1ed9c thi ch\u00ednh ti\u1ebfp theo tr\u01b0\u1edbc Paralympics m\u00f9a \u0111\u00f4ng 2014 l\u00e0 s\u1ef1 ki\u1ec7n th\u1eed nghi\u1ec7m \u1edf
