{"source_text": "have a total of 99 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\nThe pensioners spend most of the year saving for Christmas gifts.\nTheir eleven children have brought them 56 grandchildren and 43 great-grandchildren.\nThe kids just kept coming \u2013 and then their kids just kept coming, said Josie, 77, to the Sun newspaper.\nHusband Hans was a prisoner of war in World War II, and went to work as a farmer for Josie's family.\nWhile there is no existing record with Guinness for alive couples with the most grandchildren, Guinness World Records authorities say the couple very well might hold the record.\nGlasgow resident Margaret McMillan had 123 grandchildren, but died last year at 98.\nIt wasn't until her funeral that the number, which included 15 great-great-grandchildren, was established by the family.\nGovernor Jon Corzine announced a bill that would provide $270 million to stem cell research.\n\"He announced, \"\"I don't want New Jersey to join the crowd of stem cell research states, I want New Jersey to lead it.\"\"\"\nBusinessWeek reports that the announcement came two days after Corzine announced that the state will give out $10 million in research grants next year, including $7 million for stem cell research.\nA 15-year-old boy who allegedly stole a Melbourne, Australia tram and drove for 40 minutes picking up and setting down passengers, may yet be allowed to work as a tram driver, despite his nine charges related to the incident.\nWe have a very good recruiting policy and anybody who passes the muster for our recruiting policy we'd be glad to offer a job to, provided he's old enough to hold a driver's license, Yarra Trams Deputy Chief Executive, Dennis Cliche, told Australian Associated Press on Monday.\n\"Detective Senior Constable Barry Hills of Victoria Police, said of the boy, \"\"He's a nice lad, he's a good lad.\"\"\"\nI think his obsession just got the better of him.\nDescribed as wearing a jacket similar to official Yarra Trams uniforms, the boy was caught on Sunday night by police in east suburban Kew, 15km from where the tram was stolen, when electricity was shut off to the route.\nHe is also accused of stealing a tram on Friday night, from South Melbourne depot.\nHowever Jason Robinson and Olly Barkley scored tries late in the first half for England, with the score 21-3 at half time.\nNine minutes after the interval Tom Rees scored England's third try, but they were not able to score again.\nMatekitonga Moeakiola scored for the Americans in the 74th minute.\nHans and Josie Schaffer of Bedford, United Kingdom are possibly world record holders, now that they have a total of 99 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.", "source_lang": "en", "target_text": "c\u00f3 t\u1ed5ng c\u1ed9ng 99 \u0111\u1ee9a ch\u00e1u
