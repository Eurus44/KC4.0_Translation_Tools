{"source_text": "The South African deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad confirmed on Thursday that the country is preparing a meeting with the controversial group.\r\nAccording to Pahad South Africa wishes to share its experiences on the transformation from the Apartheid-era to democracy with the Palestinians and Israel.\r\nSouth Africa also sees it important to keep in contact with Hamas in the search for peace in the Middle East.\r\nSami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spookesman said that there is no date for talks with South Africa yet.\r\nRussia has invited leaders of the Hamas for talks, which will begin on Friday.\r\nThe Russian invitation was the first one after the elections of January 2006.\r\nHowever, Russia has put Hamas under pressure to recognize Israel and renounce violence.\r\nThere have been talks between Hamas leaders and the Turkish foreign minister, Abdullah Gul.\r\n\"Israeli foreign ministry spokesman voiced his ministry's concerns that \"\"giving legitimacy to an unreformed Hamas\"\" could turn the movement \"\"from a terrorist organization to a political party\"\".\"\r\nGary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 2004/2005 season of the National Hockey League has been canceled.\r\nThe announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days.\r\nThe dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players.\r\nThe majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount.\r\nThe club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million.\r\n\"Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said \"\"The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.\"\"\"\r\nThis will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded.\r\nThat year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off.", "source_lang": "en", "target_text": "Th\u1ee9 tr\u01b0\u1edfng Ngo\u1ea1i giao Nam Phi Aziz Pahad x\u00e1c nh\u1eadn h\u00f4m th\u1ee9 N\u0103m r\u1eb1ng n\u01b0\u1edbc n\u00e0y \u0111ang chu\u1ea9n b\u1ecb m\u1ed9t cu\u1ed9c h\u1ecdp v\u1edbi nh\u00f3m g\u00e2y tranh c\u00e3i.\nTheo Pahad Nam Phi, mong mu\u1ed1n chia s\u1ebb kinh nghi\u1ec7m c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh v\u1ec1 s\u1ef1 chuy\u1ec3n \u0111\u1ed5i t\u1eeb Apartheid -
