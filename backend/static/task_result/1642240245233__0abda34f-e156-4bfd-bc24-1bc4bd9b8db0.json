{"source_text": "\"Israeli foreign ministry spokesman voiced his ministry's concerns that \"\"giving legitimacy to an unreformed Hamas\"\" could turn the movement \"\"from a terrorist organization to a political party\"\".\"\r\nGary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 2004/2005 season of the National Hockey League has been canceled.\r\nThe announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days.\r\nThe dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players.\r\nThe majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount.\r\nThe club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million.\r\n\"Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said \"\"The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.\"\"\"\r\nThis will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded.\r\nThat year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off.\r\nMichael Jackson's This Is It, a documentary film based on world-famous singer Michael Jackson rehearsing for his last tour before his untimely death, will be premiered in at least 15 cinemas in cities all over the world simultaneously.\r\nThe film is due to premiere on October 27 and October 28.\r\nThe world cities may be in different time zones with different dates but they will all be premiering the film at exactly the same time.\r\nOne such premiere location is Los Angeles, in the US state of California, which will have the film starting at 1800 PT.\r\nAnother simultaneity is the Odeon Leicester Square cinema in London, England, which will start at 0100 GMT on October 27.\r\nOther locations holding concurrent premieres are the South African city of Johannesburg, New York City in New York, German capital Berlin, Russian capital city Moscow, Japanese capital Tokyo, Australian city Sydney, French capital Paris, South Korean city Seoul, and Rio de Janeiro, a large city in Brazil.", "source_lang": "en", "target_text": "\"Ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u00e1t ng\u00f4n B\u1ed9 Ngo\u1ea1i giao Israel cho bi\u1ebft nh\u1eefng lo ng\u1ea1i c\u1ee7a B\u1ed9 r\u1eb1ng\" \"l\u00e0m h\u1ee3p ph\u00e1p cho m\u1ed9t Hamas kh\u00f4ng c\u1ea3i c\u00e1ch\" \"c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 chuy\u1ec3n \u0111\u1ed9ng\" \"t\u1eeb m\u1ed9t t\u1ed5 ch\u1ee9c kh\u1ee7ng b\u1ed1 sang m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ea3ng ch\u00ednh tr\u1ecb.\"\nGary Bettman, \u1ee7y vi\u00ean c\u1ee7a NHL, h\u00f4m nay \u0111\u00e3 th\u00f4ng b\u00e1o r\u1eb1ng m\u00f9a gi\u1ea3i 2004 / 2005 c\u1ee7a Li\u00ean minh Hockey Qu\u1ed1c gia \u0111\u00e3 b\u1ecb h\u1ee7y b\u1ecf.\nTh\u00f4ng b\u00e1o n\u00e0y ch\u1ec9 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c th\u1ef1c hi\u1ec7n nh\u01b0 m\u1ed9t x\u00e1c nh\u1eadn ch\u00ednh th\u1ee9c v\u1ec1 nh\u1eefng g\u00ec \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c d\u1ef1 \u0111o\u00e1n l\u00e0 hoang d\u00e3 \u0111\u00e3 n\u1ed5i l\u00ean trong v\u00e0i ng\u00e0y qua.\nTranh ch\u1ea5p n\u00e0y t\u1eadp trung v\u00e0o c\u00e1c n\u1eafp tr\u1ea3 l\u01b0\u01a1ng c\u1ee7a c\u1ea7u th\u1ee7, n\u01a1i m\u00e0 c\u00e1c c\u1ea7u th\u1ee7 ph\u1ea3n \u0111\u1ed1i li\u00ean t\u1ee5c.\nPh\u1ea7n l\u1edbn c\u00e1c c\u00e2u l\u1ea1c b\u1ed9 NHL \u0111\u00e3 m\u1ea5t ti\u1ec1n trong 5 n\u0103m qua v\u00e0 k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 l\u00e0 c\u00e1c c\u00e2u l\u1ea1c b\u1ed9 mu\u1ed1n tr\u1ea3 ti\u1ec1n v\u1edbi s\u1ed1 ti\u1ec1n thi\u1ebft y\u1ebfu.\nCh\u1ee7 c\u00e2u l\u1ea1c b\u1ed9 s\u1ebd kh\u00f4ng v\u01b0\u1ee3t qu\u00e1 42,5 tri\u1ec7u \u0111\u00f4 cho b\u1ea5t k\u1ef3 c\u00e2u l\u1ea1c b\u1ed9 n\u00e0o, trong khi c\u00e1c c\u1ea7u th\u1ee7 t\u1eeb ch\u1ed1i \u0111i xu\u1ed1ng d\u01b0\u1edbi 49 tri\u1ec7u \u0111\u00f4 la.\n\"N\u00f3i v\u1ec1 vi\u1ec7c h\u1ee7y b\u1ecf, Gary Bettman n\u00f3i\" \"\u0110i\u1ec1u x\u1ea5u h\u1ed5 l\u00e0 ng\u01b0\u1eddi h\u00e2m m\u1ed9 c\u1ee7a ch\u00fang t\u00f4i x\u1ee9ng \u0111\u00e1ng t\u1ed1t h\u01a1n.\"\n\u0110\u00e2y s\u1ebd l\u00e0 n\u0103m \u0111\u1ea7u ti\u00ean k\u1ec3 t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1919 khi Stanley Cup -
